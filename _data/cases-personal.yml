    <p> 
      The Tempest was a massive project for me where performance capture was merged with traditional stage show control to produce a realtime avatar, driven live on stage, and controlled through external tools over network languages, mainly DMX, OSC, and PSN </p>
    </p>  
    I created the Unreal project and merged all the elements together, including all the state logic, visual changes, and materials and particle fx.

      <p> On Game of Thrones (Season 8), I designed and produced virtual production tools, mainly utilising VR, for previsualisation and shot-planning, 
      used for the more complex scenes, the primary tool being <a href=https://pathfinder.thethirdfloorinc.com/> Pathfinder</a>,
      which allows you to both both scout locations and to plan camera shots. </p>

    Star Citizen's Squadren 42 was a very large project for me, taking place over two years. My role was to drive and manage the realtime visualisation. Since this was (at the time) a CryEngine game, the realtime was all performed in CryEngine, in the actual game client. 
    This allowed our realtime to closely reflect the end-result.

        <h2 class="display-6"> What Experience do I have? </h2>
        <p> I have been working in Industry for <strong>{{ years_since_2012 }}</strong> years, since leaving University in 2012, and using Unreal Engine for longer than that. In
            that time I have worked across film & TV, video games, theatre and more. </p>
        <p> I initially started with <span class="text-info"> UDK </span>, where I found the passion for game
            development, then started using <span class="text-info"> Unreal Engine 4.6 </span> in industry in 2012, for realtime visualisation of performance capture,
            and used Unreal Engine practically every work day since. </p>

    <section data-aos="fade-up">
        <h2 class="display-6"> Detailed Work History </h2>
        <p>
            I started work in the industry at <span class="text-info">The Imaginarium Studios </span>, in 2012, where
            I worked for almost six years on a large number of fantastic projects. I was focused mainly on performance
            capture, and utilising game engines to further the motion capture industry.
            I worked on lots of games, films, TV shows, music videos, and other miscellaneous projects there. Since the
            Imaginarium was a fairly small company (at the time), myself and my very talented colleagues covered many roles to ensure
            projects were the best they could be, and allowed me to gain many useful skills not limited to a single role. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I took on my first lead development role in 2016 for The Royal Shakespeare Company's "The Tempest".  
            I progreammed the engine and worked with an incredibly talented character artist, and expert character rigger to build Ariel in their many forms for the live production.
            Epic did a great write-up of the work myself and others did on  which can be viewed here: 
            <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-brings-virtual-character-to-life-onstage-in-the-royal-shakespeare-companys-the-tempest"
            _target="blank"> Unreal Engine Brings Virtual Character to Life Onstage in The Royal Shakespeare Company’s The Tempest <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i> </a>.

            There is also a white-paper on motion capture, featuring much of the work on the Tempest, here,
            <a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Unreal+Engine%2Fperformance-capture-whitepaper-final%2FUnreal-Engine_performance-capture-whitepaper_LPC_Whitepaper_final-7f4163190d9926a15142eafcca15e8da5f4d0701.pdf"

        </p>

        <p>
            From June 2017, I started working at <span class="text-info">The Third Floor Inc </span>, London branch.
            The Third Floor specialises in Pre-Visualisation, and I worked within the R&D department to develop Unreal
            Engine tools and pipelines to facilitate it's adoption in the film pipeline.
            This included new virtual production tools utilising virtual reality and augmented reality to bring a new dimension to the virtual production toolkit. 
            I also assisted the Immersive department in technical implementations for developing more experimental or XR related projects, 
            including production of their own game, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.madfactoryvr.com/" target="_blank"> Mad Factory
                VR <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a>.

            The XR tools that I created at the Third Floor have received a great write-up by Epic Games, and can be
            viewed here:

        </p>
        <p>
            From September 2019, I started work at <span class="text-info">The Royal Shakespeare Company </span> as the Lead Developer for the 
            <a href="https://audienceofthefuture.live/dream/">Audiences of the Future <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a> project. 

            I took charge on the Unreal Engine technical development, and working with support from the web team, art team, and various other departments, we captured a live performance each night, utilising performance capture, 
            to bring bespoke digital characters to life. Each performance was unique, with dynamic user-input from the collective audience shaping the performance. 
            Mass audience interaction, via the web, into Unreal Engine, amalgamated into usable data, drove visual effects, and real-world lighting to direct performers and make each nights performance a unique experience.
            A custom cue system, initially tiggered via traditional lighting desk, and routed via Unreal Engine, drove the show in a theatre style setup, but with very new oppertunities. 
            A fully dynamic audio system, driven by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactionalmusic.com/"> Gestrument (Now Reactional Music) </a> powered dynamic sound landscapes with beautiful unique music each night.

        <p> I have been using some development time to produce high-end assets for the Unreal Marketplace. As I have
            been doing Unreal for quite some time its a great platform to grow a portfolio of products. I try to
            maintain a high bar for quality, and keep
            the assets up to date as the engine matures. I have also found it's another area which is great for learning
            new features and skills I have yet to master </p>

        <p>
            I love learning and developing my own content, the more challenging the more I will learn, and so the more I
            enjoy it. Time is always a constraint, but when I can, I love to work on new game ideas and projects. I can't wait to share more as these ideas develop.

        <h2 class="display-6"> Hobbies </h2>
        <p>
            Outside of development, which I do spend a lot of time on, I love to grab my DSLR and explore through
            photography. I'm also an avid gamer across all platforms, and I particularly love to explore indie games, to
            support the developers and research what others are making.
        </p>
        <p> I also host a Discord server, both in support of my own products that are for sale, and for general
            community help, which has over 400 members </p>

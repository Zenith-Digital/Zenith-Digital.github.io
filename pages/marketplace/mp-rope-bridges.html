            Introducing the Dynamic Rope Bridge, a revolutionary digital asset that dynamically responds to players,
            environmental elements like wind, and objects on its path. Designed for versatility, it&#39;s modular,
            allowing customization in length and appearance
            with any meshes. It&#39;s optimized for high performance, with a special sleep system for enhanced
            efficiency.
            Easy to integrate, it comes as a single drag-and-drop blueprint. Discover more through our overview video
            and a
            detailed tutorial on customizing
            meshes, perfect for adding interactive elements to your game environments.</p>

        <h2>Features: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Ready to use, Drag-And-Drop, customise your details, and done. </li>
            <li> Dynamic response to players or objects, looks organic and realistic when you run across it.</li>
            <li> Optional wind system to add additional movement, at a small performance cost. </li>
            <li>Optimised as much as possible, just 1 single physics component, the rest is ISMs, spline meshes, or
                static meshes. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> How to Use </h2>

        <p> Install the pack from the Unreal Engine Marketplace. </p>
        <p> In the content browser, navigate to RopeBridges/Blueprints, and drag the Rope Bridge blueprint into your
            world </p>
        <p> With the blueprint selected in the world outliner, position it on the start of your bridge, then select the
            3D Vector widget (purple diamond), and move that to the end of your bridge </p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p> Not all elements of the bridge will draw in editor. The bridge only supports physics and some other
                features in runtime </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="/assets/img/mp/bridges/RopeBridge_DetailsPanel.png" class="img-fluid"
                        alt="Rope Bridge Details Panel">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p> The details panel has the most common attributes to customise. Most of these have tooltips that
                        will explain more when you mouse over them.</p>
                    <p> Drop down the Posts and Ropes section to customise those elements. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2> Mesh Customisation </h2>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li> Bridge Slats - These can be customised in the details panel, and supports random meshes. Add one or
                more meshes to <code>Bridge Mesh Slat List</code>.
                The bridge is X forward, so on a bridge slat, the Y axis would point down the board.

                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <p>You can easily use the modelling tools in UE5 to re-orient your axis:
                        Drag your mesh into the world, zero its transform, rotate 90 in Z so its correctly orientated
                        for bridge, then use the modelling tools - "BakeRS" tool to burn that 90 rotation into the mesh.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>Posts - These can be set directly in the detail panel. Their position matches the lower rope offsets.
                They use a <code>Instanced Static Mesh Component</code>, so your material will need that added to its
                usage if it shows up untextured. </li>
            <li>Rope - The rope is set within blueprint, and is not exposed currently. This is because it uses a Spline
                Mesh Component, so its ideal to stick with the 1cm_Tube mesh used. If you want to customise it, or swap
                its materials, open the
                <code> Update Rope</code> function (the singular, not Update Ropes). In that function is the
                <code> Add Spline Mesh Component </code> node, select that, and override as needed.
                Remember if you change material, your new material will need its usage updated to include "Spline Mesh
                Component" in the material editor.
            </li>
        </ul>
